Overview

The Pipeline Wall-Thickness Software is a tool designed for analyzing and evaluating the wall thickness of pipelines. It provides a user-friendly interface for importing pipeline data, performing calculations, and generating reports. This software is particularly useful for pipeline integrity management, ensuring compliance with safety standards, and making informed decisions about maintenance and repairs.

Features
Import Pipeline Data: Easily import pipeline data from various sources, including GIS files, CAD drawings, or manual input.

Interactive Visualization: Visualize pipeline geometry in 2D and 3D for a better understanding of the structure.

Wall Thickness Analysis: Perform wall thickness calculations based on industry standards and user-defined criteria.

Report Generation: Generate detailed reports with comprehensive information about the pipeline, including thickness profiles, potential weak points, and recommended actions.

User Configurable: Customize analysis parameters and criteria based on specific project requirements.

Multi-Platform Compatibility: The software is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.
